# GTSAM

## BCR Maintainer Notes

### Known Issues

* Currently, python binding for gtsam is not supported on bzlmod.

### Libraries

* `@gtsam//:gtsam` - This library is a set of variable and factor types typically used in SFM and
SLAM.
* `@gtsam//:gtsam_unstable` - This library is a set of experimental additions to gtsam that are not fully ready to be integrated into the rest of the library. This library is actively maintained, and should follow the same design procedures as gtsam.

### Configuration Headers

* `gtsam/config.h`, `gtsam/dllexport.h`, `gtsam_unstable/dllexport.h` are generated by `cmake_configure_file`.
