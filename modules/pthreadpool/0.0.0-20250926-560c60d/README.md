# Overlay note

The BUILD.bazel file in the original repository is not compatible with bzlmod, so instead of adding a massive patch file, we provide our own BUILD.bazel file here.
The upstream pull request updating the original project to bzlmod is [here](https://github.com/Maratyszcza/pthreadpool/pull/54).
